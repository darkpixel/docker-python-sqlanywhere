Since dockerhub decided to start charing for automated builds of public images, I'm not going to go through the hassle
of manually shoving images up to dockerhub.

You can now pull the image from the GitHub Container Registery:

docker pull ghcr.io/darkpixel/docker-python-sqlanywhere/docker-python-sqlanywhere:latest
